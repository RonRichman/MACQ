# MACQ
This repository contains code to apply the Marginal Attribution by Conditioning on Quantiles (MACQ) method of Merz et al. (2021). The code relates to Section 4 of the paper and shows how the MACQ method can be applied to a synthetic example.

Please note that we have used TensorFlow 2.6.0 for this example, as implemented in the R keras package.
